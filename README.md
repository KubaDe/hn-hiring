https://friendly-archimedes-f9254d.netlify.com/

### Main tech stack
* React
* Type Script
* MobX
* Axios
* Fuse.js

### Running app
To run app: 
`yarn start`

To build app: 
`yarn build`

To run linter: 
`yarn lint-ts`

### Known issues
* UI is in wireframe style. It can be reimplemented with custom designs.
* Inline styling should be replaced with styled components / styles from different file. 
* Fuse Search options might be better adjusted.
* Tags can be used for further content analysis.
