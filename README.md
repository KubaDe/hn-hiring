* Inline styling should be replaced with styled components / styles from different file. 
* Fuse Search options might be better adjusted.
* Tags can be used for further content analysis.
* Filters could be more dynamic - prepared according to posts content
* Filter for salary could be implemented
* RWD very basic with some layout bugs
* Long requests could be cancelled in case of leaving the page before content load
* Chaotic git workflow and commit messages
* Enter the page and pass thread ID witch is not "Ask HN: Who is hiring?" type
